# IntegerFactorization---Chrom-is-M
The chromosome in this version is changed to represent the continuous variable m in the 
formula 6m +- 1, which means that getting a prime number will be more likely

Note: not all numbers that satisfy the formula 6m+-1 are primes, 
      but all primes satisfy that formula.
